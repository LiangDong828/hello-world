# hello-world
welcome to a new world!



 I am a new grad student in UWaterloo, majored in communication technology in department of ECE. But since communication uses lots of math especially probability theory and statistics, I am very interested in data science. Hope I will have fun learning it~
keep calm and carry onÔºÅ
